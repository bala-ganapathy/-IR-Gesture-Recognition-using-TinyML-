# -IR-Gesture-Recognition-using-TinyML-
A TinyML project that classifies three types of human motion—Pass by, Stay, and Wave—using an IR sensor. The pipeline includes data collection, model training, local inference with TFLite, and on-device deployment on ESP32 using a Random Forest model exported via EverywhereML.
